This repository is a game modelled of the game Simon. It was made with html, css and jQuery.

To begin the game, you are asked to press any key. It will then show you a pile to click on.

As you move from level to level, the pattern gets more and more complicated.

At some point, you will eventually screw up as everyone does, and it will tell you Game Over any can press any key to start again.
